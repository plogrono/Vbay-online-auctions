# Vbay-online-auctions
Vbay is an imitation of a very popular auction website with a very similar name.  A high-level
conceptual data model of the business processes supporting vBay are:

* Users are buyers and/or sellers.
* Users post items for sale as sellers.
* Users place bids on items as buyers.
* The highest bid “wins” the item, and that user buys it.
* Users rate each other as buyers and sellers.
  
_This database was created by Professor Michael Fudge, one of the professors in the Master's program I completed at Syracuse.
The data is in the Microsoft SQL Server Database Management System,  and the client I am using to connect is Azure Data Studio.  This project is based on two homework assignments I merged together._ 

First part of markdown is getting to know my data.
